# PEGASUSX : NEXT GEN VOTING SYSTEM
## INTRODUCTION
PegasusX is a web-app voting system prototype empowered by blockchain technology.
But what is a blockchain? And why blockchain?

Block chain has been the talk of the town in recent years. and it’s reasonable.
Block chain is one of the new technologies along with AI, that was born in the 21st century. And, eventually, people got obsessed with it because of its incredulous data security features. Ever since then, Block chain has become the need of the hour.
Block chain is seen as a modern-day tamper-proof data structure. Think of Block chain as a linked list where each node/block contains hash of previous node (except the first block), transaction id, block id, and etc. Now, answering the question, why block chain? Here, is the thing, unlike linked list, in block chain we can’t delete a block like we can delete a node in linked list. Once, it’s inserted it’s always there; nothing can change it. This special property is called immutability, and this is why it’s tamper-proof.
So, that should be pretty much enough to hint how block chain can revolutionize voting systems.
